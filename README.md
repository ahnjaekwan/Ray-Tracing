# Ray-Tracing
Ray tracing generates an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane. 

Notes:

1. I used ray casting algorithm, which determines the shading of the closest object from the eye.
2. I used recursive ray tracing algorithm in which reflection, refraction, and shadow are recursively generated when a ray hits a surface in order to make ray traced images appear more realistic.
